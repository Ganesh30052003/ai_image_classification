# ai_image_classification
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application for image classification using pre-trained deep learning models. The app allows users to upload images and get predictions along with confidence scores. It is designed to be simple, interactive, and user-friendly, providing real-time classification results.

Features
Model Selection:
Supports multiple pre-trained models:
CIFAR-10 Classification Model
MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)
Image Upload:
Accepts images in common formats like JPG, PNG, and JPEG.
File size limit: 200MB.
Real-time Predictions:
Displays the predicted class and its confidence score for the uploaded image.
Interactive Interface:
Built using Streamlit, providing a modern and responsive UI.
Ease of Deployment:
Can be deployed on local systems or cloud platforms.
How It Works
Choose a Model: Select the desired pre-trained model from the sidebar.
Upload an Image: Drag and drop an image or use the file browser to upload.
View Results: The app processes the image and displays:
Predicted class.
Confidence score.
Uploaded image preview.
Models Included:
CIFAR-10: Designed for 10-class image classification tasks such as airplanes, horses, cars, etc.
MobileNetV2 (ImageNet): Efficient deep learning model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset for classifying a wide range of objects.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python)
Backend: Pre-trained deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
Deployment: Designed for local or cloud deployment.
Other Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
PIL (for image processing)
Streamlit components
Installation and Usage
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-webapp.git
cd image-classification-webapp
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
After running the command, open your browser and visit the URL provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501).

4. Upload an Image
Select a model (CIFAR-10 or MobileNetV2).
Upload an image to see the classification result along with confidence.
Screenshots
CIFAR-10 Classification
Example of classifying an image of a horse with a confidence score.

MobileNetV2 Classification
Example of identifying an African elephant using MobileNetV2.

Planned Improvements
Add more pre-trained models for classification.
Integrate additional features like:
Multiple image uploads.
Model comparison.
Deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud).
Enhance the UI with custom themes.
